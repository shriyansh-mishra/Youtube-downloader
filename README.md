# YouTube Playlist Downloader

## Project Description

This is an asynchronous Python script that allows you to download entire YouTube playlists quickly and efficiently. The script uses `pytube` for video downloading and `asyncio` for concurrent downloads, enabling faster retrieval of multiple videos.

## Features

- Download entire YouTube playlists
- Asynchronous downloading for improved performance
- Automatically selects highest resolution video streams
- Provides download progress tracking

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- pytube library
- asyncio library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/youtube-playlist-downloader.git
cd youtube-playlist-downloader
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install pytube
```

## How It Works

1. The script uses `Playlist` to extract all video URLs from a given playlist
2. It creates an asynchronous download task for each video
3. `asyncio.gather()` runs all download tasks concurrently
4. Videos are downloaded in the highest available resolution

## Cautions

- Ensure you have the right to download videos
- Respect YouTube's terms of service
- Be mindful of copyright restrictions

## Potential Improvements

- Add error handling
- Implement download progress bar
- Allow custom resolution selection
- Add option to specify download directory

## Dependencies

- pytube
- asyncio
